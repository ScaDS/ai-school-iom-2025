# Plotting Basics

This session is centered on Seaborn's figure-level functions, which provide a high-level interface for drawing statistical graphics. We use Seaborn's built-in functionalities to create comprehensive plots without the need to manually handle Matplotlib objects. This simplifies the process, making it easier for those new to programming. We will learn how to visualize tabular data using the Seaborn library. We will start by visualizing basic relational charts before moving on to distributions and, if time permits, multivariate views.
